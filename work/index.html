            <p class="work_intro">I first started with web design and development 10 years ago. My academic background is in Business Management with specialization in Marketing and my initial interest in web design was to enable me to give direction, feedback, and critique that was helpful and useful to those developers I was working with. With Marketing becoming more and more digital, these skills helped me immensely in creating HTML emails, creating temporary web pages and pushing me to be more involved in the creation of branding and identity through visual design. On this page, you will find The Digital Factory's digital portfolio. Some of these projects were completed independently and some as part of courses to further enhance my skills. </p>

This is another project work-in-progress taken on in steps to complete several small projects at a time. The previous website was created in WordPress but it was in this instance better to redesign the website to ensure that the layout and user experience was improved as well as optimizing for Search Engines. This site was created with Bootstrap and will be updated with a completed UI redesign once more user data and website content has been gathered. Currently we are busy implementing a Social Media strategy for Hazleton Pumps making use of Twitter and LinkedIn. </p>
